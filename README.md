# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Hereâ€™s a **simple and complete GitHub repository structure** for a Streamlit-based game (like your Tic-Tac-Toe app). It keeps things clean and beginner-friendly, while also professional enough for showcasing:

```
tic-tac-toe-streamlit/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Streamlit application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # List of dependencies (streamlit, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md               # Project description, setup, and usage guide
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ game/                   # Game logic package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logic.py            # Game rules, moves, winner check
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai.py               # AI algorithms (Minimax, random strategy, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py            # Helper functions if needed
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                 # Store static files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/             # Game icons, logos, screenshots
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ css/                # Optional custom styling
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Unit tests for game logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_logic.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_ai.py
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore              # Ignore cache, venv, etc.
```

### ðŸ”‘ What each part does:

* **`app.py`** â†’ Runs the Streamlit UI (board, buttons, reset).
* **`game/logic.py`** â†’ Core rules (winner check, available moves, draw check).
* **`game/ai.py`** â†’ Intelligent system (Minimax, DFS, or heuristic strategies).
* **`assets/`** â†’ Keeps images/icons if you want a polished UI.
* **`tests/`** â†’ Ensures logic and AI are working correctly.
* **`requirements.txt`** â†’ For reproducibility (`streamlit==1.x`, etc.).
* **`README.md`** â†’ Explains how to run, features, screenshots, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, the repo looks professional, modular, and easy to extend (like adding another game later).

Would you like me to also **write a sample `README.md`** for this repo with features, setup, and screenshots section?
